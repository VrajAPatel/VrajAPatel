- 👋 Hi, I’m @VrajAPatel
- 👀 I’m interested in WEB-DEVELOPMENT
- 🌱 I’m currently learning FRONTEND Technologies from scratch like HTML5, CSS3, JS, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, React JS/Angular JS, and also looking for many more which are being used in real life.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people also learning the same technologies. Please feel free to reach out.
